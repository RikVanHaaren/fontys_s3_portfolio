> Inside this directory you can find the documentation needed for the realisation of this project.

I am going to develop a web store where user of the community ‚ÄúMX bikes‚Äù can subscribe/ download digital product (mods). Where creating a better experience for these users and improve the game use. The goal is to create a safe, fast, reliable and simple application that can expand as it growth.

##  1. Introduction
This document is used as a guide for the directory. In the chapters below you can see what the content is of each file and what learning goal I acquired. You can see the document with all the information if you click on a link below the description.


## 2. Project Documentation

### 2.1 Requirements 
> Learning outcome: [Requirements and design](/learningOutcomes.md#6-Requirements-and-design)

Inside this file you can read about the functional and non functional requirements. These requirements define the purpose and outcome of the product and what I am building.    
[View file](./requirements.md)

### 2.2 UX Documentation
