# Concept idea

The idea I have is to build an web application that is a digital web shop. 
This web shop is specifically for user that are playing MX-Bikes and don’t want to pain to download all the mods from third party websites like: Dropbox, One-drive and Google drive.
MX Bikes is a game developed by Piboso, he states that the game is a: “MX Bikes is a realistic motocross simulator, based on a scratch built physics engine that accurately simulates motorcycle dynamics and setup options. MX Bikes also allows to host and join online races, with an integrated matchmaking server. During events data is collected, to provide statistics for riders' comparison.”.  The community can add mods inside the game for an extension on the current items. Current process to install the mods look likes below:
1)	The user needs to open internet and goes to the a forum where a list of mods show up.
2)	The user clicks on a mods he want to use and then searches through the article for a download link.
3)	Once found the user will be redirected to a third party website where he can download the file.
4)	When the file is downloaded the user needs to unzip the file and place it in de mod folder of the game.
5)	The user can now start the game and can use the mod he just installed.

## The cons of the current process
- **Efficiency**: you have to look through a forum for something u want to use. You’re getting only a title, create date and creator information. This isn’t a good user experience, imagine you want to buy some new cloths and you only see the title. Also the third party website were the download file is available, are often very slow because you don’t have the subscription.
- **Third parties**: these parties are often very slow and needs a subscription for a decent download speed. It is normal to wait 16 minutes for only 731,4 KB/s.
- **Safety**: a lot of the time the user that downloaded the mods has download a .zip file. As we know these file can contain vires ferly easy. 
- **Different versions**: often a creator update his mods because his missed something. In this process you need to keep installing the newer mods to play with other. You also don’t know if an update occur, you only know this when you try to join.
