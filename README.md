## Learning Outcomes
| # | Title | Short Description | Clarification |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Web application | You design and build **user-friendly**, **full-stack** web applications. | **User friendly**: You apply basic User experience testing and development techniques. <br><br>**Full-stack**: You design and build a full stack application using commonly accepted front end (Javascript-based framework) and back end techniques (e.g. Object Relational Mapping) choosing and implementing relevant communication protocols and addressing asynchronous communication issues. |
| 2 | Software quality | You use software **tooling and methodology** that continuously monitors and improve the software quality during software development. | **Tooling and methodology**: Carry out, monitor and report on unit integration, regression and system tests, with attention for security and performance aspects, as well as applying static code analysis and code reviews. |
| 3 | Agile method | You can implement the software process for your project according to a given agile software development method. | **Agile method**: You are aware of most popular agile methods and their underlying agile principles. You are able to implement the process of your software project according to a chosen methodology. |
| 4 | CI/CD | You **implement** a (semi)automated software release process that matches the needs of the project context. | **Implement**: You implement a continuous integration and delivery solution (using e.g. Gitlab CI and Docker). |
| 5 | Cultural differences and ethics | You **recognize** and **take into account** cultural differences when working with multi-site teams, and are aware of ethical aspects in software development. | **Recognize**: Recognition is based on theoretically substantiated awareness of cultural differences and ethical aspects in software engineering. <br><br>**Take into account**: Adapt your communication, working, and behavior styles to work with other developers from different cultures; Address one of the standard Programming Ethical Guidelines (e.g., ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct) in your work. |
| 6 | Requirements and design | You translate (non-functional) requirements to extend existing (architectural) designs and can validate them using **multiple types of test techniques**. | **Multiple types of test techniques**: You apply user acceptance testing and stakeholder feedback to validate the quality of the requirements. You evaluate the quality of the design (e.g., by testing or prototyping) taking into account the formulated quality properties like security and performance. |
| 7 | Business processes | You can explain **simple** business processes and relate them to the development of your software project. | **Simple**: predominantly sequential processes with one or two alternative paths. <br><br>**Relate**: understanding the relationships between the process and software. |
| 8 | Professional | You act in a **professional manner** during software development and learning. | **Professional manner**: You develop software as a team effort according to a prescribed software methodology and following team agreements. You are able to track your work progress and communicate your progress with the team. You independently recognize and decide where your knowledge falls short to solve a software problem and communicate which new knowledge and skills you need to learn. |
