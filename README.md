##  1. Introduction
This document focuses on the learning outcomes of this semster. Every chapter describes what learning outcomes I acquired and how I did it with a file redirection at the bottom.

## 2. Research
In this section you can read about the learning goals research to implement them. Inside the project you can see how I implement them.

### 2.1 Agile methodology
> Learning outcome: [Agile method](/learningOutcomes.md#3-Agile-method)

During this semster we worked based on a agile methodology. Because there are lot of methodology I was required to do some research wich one was the best option for my projects. So I took the most popular methods and wrote the advantage and disadvantage Inside you can read about the "agile iterative approach to project management and software development" and the different "methodologies".

## 3. Individual Project (MxBikesClient)
For my individual project I had chosen an idea that I wanted to create for a long time. It was for a game I played a lot but it had some user experience issues. In this project I solved that problem by automating steps that a user was required to take. Inside this file every chapter contains learning outcomes that I aquired from creating it.

## 4. Group Project (IsItLive)
For the group project we got an asignment from [World of Content](https://worldofcontent.com/nl-nl/). They wanted us to create a live score metric on how much content can internally be found on a reatiler's website. Inside this file every chapter contains learning outcomes that I aquired from creating it.
