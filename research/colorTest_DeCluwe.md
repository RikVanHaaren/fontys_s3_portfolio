# Color test by De Caluwé
We were supposed to get a workshop about this learning outcome, unfortunately it was canceled due to circumstances. For this workshop everyone was asked to do 2 tests where one test was about De Caluwé's Color Test and the other was about team roles. I was very curious about the color test and I researched it myself. 

Before I started making the De Caluwé Color Test, I first read through what this test entails. The purpose of this color test is to strengthen my insight into the way you think and act in a change process. This test shows where my relative preferences lie based on the 5 colors containing the change management groups. It also shows to what extent my thinking and actions are in agreement.

After taking the test, I went to look at the color that was the highest and the color that was the lowest. The color white stood out the most to me: responsible, stubborn, self-chosen, chaos theory and intuition. And the color blue was the lowest: a deal is a deal, diagnosis, objectives, drawing up plans and KSF’en pi’s.

I find it very interesting how in my opinion this score corresponds to my personal opinion. You can read specific points that I was good at and less good at in the reflection and here I saw points that match.

The De Caluwé color test is all about self-improvement, if you score lower on a color then you can consciously think about it and consider how you can improve it. This allows you to ensure that you can share any problems you have within a group so that others can take this into account or you can work on it yourself. Unless you are happy with the result then you don't have to change anything here.

Because this blue has come out the least strongly and I can also see it in the reflection. That is why I have written down a number of points from this color that I can improve on. For example, one of these points is planning. In the reflection I tell that I was busy helping others and that my focus was too much on the group project. In the reflection I write that I should better divide my priorities together with my time.
