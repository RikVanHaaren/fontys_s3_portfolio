# Distributed system
The original term distributed system referred to computer networks where individual computers were physically distributed within some geographical area. Nowadays this term used in much wider sense, referring to autonomous processes that run on the same physical computer and interact with each other by message passing. This is because there is no definition stated, but only properties and characteristics that are commonly used. A good description of a distributed systems would be: “it is a collection of separate and independent software or hardware components that are called nodes. The nodes are linked together by a network and work together by coordination and communicating through a message passing or events to fulfill one end goal. The complexity remain hidden to the end-user, this can be a human or a computer. This so it can appear as only one computer.” In a simple context this means that a bunch of independent computers cooperate to solve a problem together. This comes from the graph theory.

While there is no single definition of a distributed system, the following defining properties are commonly used as:
1)	Autonomous computing has the flowing two entities computers or nodes, each of which has its own local memory.
2)	The entities communicate with each other by message passing. 
3)	The system has to tolerate failures in individual computers or nodes.
4)	The structure of the system is not know in advance, the system may consist of different kinds of computer and network links, and the system may change during the execution of distributed program.
5)	Each computer has only a limited/ incomplete view of the system. Each computer may know only one part of the input.
