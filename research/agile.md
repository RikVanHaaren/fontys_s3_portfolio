# Agile Methodology

## 1. Agile
According to Atlassian: "Agile is an iterative approach to project management and software development that helps teams deliver value to their customers faster and with fewer headaches. Instead of betting everything on a "big bang" launch, an agile team delivers work in small, but consumable, increments. Requirements, plans, and results are evaluated continuously so teams have a natural mechanism for responding to change quickly." <sup>[[1]](#3-Source)</sup>

### 1.1 Agile manifesto
The agile manifesto exist of 12 principles and 4 principles that are listed below:
The 4 agile values are listed below,
1) **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
2) **Working software** over comprehensive documentation
3) **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
4) **Responding to change** over following a plan

<br>

The 12 principles are listed below,
1)	Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
2)	Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.
3)	Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.
4)	Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.
5)	Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.
6)	The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.
7)	Working software is the primary measure of progress.
8)	Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
9)	Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.
10)	Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount of work not done--is essential.
11)	The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.
12)	At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.

## 2. Agile Methodologies


### 2.1 Scrum
Accourding to Tsonev, N.: "To understand the philosophy behind Scrum, it’s helpful to consider its origin. ‘Scrum’ is a rugby term that refers to a formation in which each player has a particular role. However, every member works together to achieve the same goal." <sup>[[3]](#3-Source)</sup>

Scrum is a framework for project management that emphasizes teamwork, accountability and iterative progress toward a well-defined goal. The framework begins with a simple premise: Start with what can be seen or known. After that, track the progress and tweak, as necessary.

**Benefits** 
1) It prescribes time-boxed iterations.
2) Cross-functional Scrum team.
3) Velocity is the default metric for process improvement and planning.
4) The scrum team faces a particular workload in an iteration.
5) Break down of items so that you can complete them in one sprint.
6) After every sprint, the board rests.
7) One can’t add new items to ongoing iterations.
8) A specific team owns the sprint backlog.
9) The product backlog is prioritized as prescribed in Scrum.

**disadvantages**
1) Scrum often leads to scope creep, due to the lack of a definite end-date
2) The chances of project failure are high if individuals aren't very committed or cooperative
3) Adopting the Scrum framework in large teams is challenging
4) The framework can be successful only with experienced team members
5) Daily meetings sometimes frustrate team members
6) If any team member leaves in the middle of a project, it can have a huge negative impact on the project
7) Quality is hard to implement until the team goes through an aggressive testing process

### 2.2 Kanban
Kanban is a Agile framework that focus on visualizing the entire project on boards in order to increase project transparency and collaboration between team members.

**Benefits** 
1) Timeboxed iteration is not compulsory.
2) Rather than being time-boxed, Kanban is event-driven.
3) There are different cadences for release, process improvement, and planning.
4) Commitment is optional.
5) Lead time is the default metric for process improvement and planning.
6) Optional cross-functional team, but teams allow specialists.
7) No particular diagram or item size is prescribed in Kanban.
8) Kanban has a natural workflow state with limited WIP.
9) Estimation is optional
10) You can always add new items whenever there’s the capacity to do that.
11) Individuals and multiples teams can share the Kanban board.
12) It doesn’t prescribe specific roles.
13) Persistency in Kanban board.
14) Prioritization is optional

**disadvantages**
1) The board has to be up-to-date because an outdated Kanban board may cause issues in the process of development.
2) Sometimes, the board can become too complicated for the Kanban team.
3) There is no timing, so the different phases don’t have timeframes attached to them.

### 2.3 Extreme Programming (XP)
Extreme programming is a software development methodology that's part of what's collectively known as agile methodologies. XP is built upon values, principles, and practices, and its goal is to allow small to mid-sized teams to produce high-quality software and adapt to evolving and changing requirements.

**Benefits**
1) The main advantage of Extreme Programming is that this methodology allows software development companies to save costs and time required for project realization. Time savings are available because of the fact that XP focuses on the timely delivery of final products. Extreme Programming teams save lots of money because they don’t use too much documentation. They usually solve problems through discussions inside of the team.
2) Simplicity is one more advantage of Extreme Programming projects. The developers who prefer to use this methodology create extremely simple code that can be improved at any moment.
3) The whole process in XP is visible and accountable. Developers commit what they will accomplish and show progress.
4) Constant feedback is also the strong side.It is necessary to listen and make any changes needed in time.
5) XP assists to create software faster thanks to the regular testing at the development stage.
6) Extreme Programming contributes increasing employee satisfaction and retention.

**disadvantages**
1) Some specialists say that Extreme Programming is focused on the code rather than on design. That may be a problem because good design is extremely important for software applications. It helps sell them in the software market. Additionally, in XP projects the defect documentation is not always good. Lack of defect documentation may lead to the occurrence of similar bugs in the future.
2) One more disadvantage of XP is that this methodology does not measure code quality assurance. It may cause defects in the initial code.
3) XP is not the best option if programmers are separated geographically.

### 2.4 Lean Development
Lean agile aims to eliminate wasteful resources and tasks for improved efficiency and reduced costs — while never sacrificing quality. In fact, lean agile prioritizes bringing value to the customer with every decision that's made. Lean agile is a development method that helps teams identify waste and refine processes.

**Benefits**
1) A streamlined approach allows more functionality to be delivered in less time.
2) Eliminates unnecessary activity, and as a result, can reduce costs.
3) Empowers the development team to make decisions, which can also boost morale.

**disadvantages**
1) Heavily depends on the team involved, making it not as scalable as other frameworks
2) Strong documentation is required, and failure to do so may result in mistakes.
