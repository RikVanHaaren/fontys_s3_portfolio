# Agile Methodology

## 1. Agile
According to Atlassian: "Agile is an iterative approach to project management and software development that helps teams deliver value to their customers faster and with fewer headaches. Instead of betting everything on a "big bang" launch, an agile team delivers work in small, but consumable, increments. Requirements, plans, and results are evaluated continuously so teams have a natural mechanism for responding to change quickly." <sup>[[1]](#3-Source)</sup>

### 1.1 Agile manifesto
The agile manifesto exist of 12 principles and 4 principles that are listed below:
The 4 agile values are listed below,
1) **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
2) **Working software** over comprehensive documentation
3) **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
4) **Responding to change** over following a plan

<br>

The 12 principles are listed below,
1)	Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
2)	Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.
3)	Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.
4)	Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.
5)	Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.
6)	The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.
7)	Working software is the primary measure of progress.
8)	Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
9)	Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.
10)	Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount of work not done--is essential.
11)	The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.
12)	At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.

## 2. Agile Methodologies


### 2.1 Scrum
Accourding to Tsonev, N.: "To understand the philosophy behind Scrum, it’s helpful to consider its origin. ‘Scrum’ is a rugby term that refers to a formation in which each player has a particular role. However, every member works together to achieve the same goal." <sup>[[3]](#3-Source)</sup>

**Benefits** 
1) It prescribes time-boxed iterations.
2) Cross-functional Scrum team.
3) Velocity is the default metric for process improvement and planning.
4) The scrum team faces a particular workload in an iteration.
5) Break down of items so that you can complete them in one sprint.
6) After every sprint, the board rests.
7) One can’t add new items to ongoing iterations.
8) A specific team owns the sprint backlog.
9) The product backlog is prioritized as prescribed in Scrum.

### 2.2 Kanban
Kanban is a Agile framework that focus on visualizing the entire project on boards in order to increase project transparency and collaboration between team members.

**Benefits** 
1) Timeboxed iteration is not compulsory.
2) Rather than being time-boxed, Kanban is event-driven.
3) There are different cadences for release, process improvement, and planning.
4) Commitment is optional.
5) Lead time is the default metric for process improvement and planning.
6) Optional cross-functional team, but teams allow specialists.
7) No particular diagram or item size is prescribed in Kanban.
8) Kanban has a natural workflow state with limited WIP.
9) Estimation is optional
10) You can always add new items whenever there’s the capacity to do that.
11) Individuals and multiples teams can share the Kanban board.
12) It doesn’t prescribe specific roles.
13) Persistency in Kanban board.
14) Prioritization is optional

**disadvantages**
1) The board has to be up-to-date because an outdated Kanban board may cause issues in the process of development.
2) Sometimes, the board can become too complicated for the Kanban team.
3) There is no timing, so the different phases don’t have timeframes attached to them.
