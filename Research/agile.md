##  1. Introduction
According to Atlassian: "Agile is an iterative approach to project management and software development that helps teams deliver value to their customers faster and with fewer headaches. Instead of betting everything on a "big bang" launch, an agile team delivers work in small, but consumable, increments. Requirements, plans, and results are evaluated continuously so teams have a natural mechanism for responding to change quickly."<sup>[[1]](#1-Colleg)</sup>

## 2. Agile
According to SixSigma: "The software developers have written the Agile Manifesto as a guideline for all the work they do. Although the manifesto is short, it contains all the important principles of Agile working. The Agile Manifesto was created to prevent Agile ideas from growing into a complex collection. So they always have a handle and guide to help them stay on track." <sup>[[1]](#3-Source)</sup>

### 2.1 Agile manifesto
The agile manifesto exist of 12 principles and 4 principles that are listed below:
The 4 agile values are listed below,
1) **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
2) **Working software** over comprehensive documentation
3) **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
4) **Responding to change** over following a plan

<br>

The 12 principles are listed below,
1)	Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
2)	Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.
3)	Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.
4)	Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.
5)	Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.
6)	The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.
7)	Working software is the primary measure of progress.
8)	Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
9)	Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.
10)	Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount of work not done--is essential.
11)	The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.
12)	At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.
