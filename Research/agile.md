##  1. Introduction


## 2. Agile
According to Atlassian: "Agile is an iterative approach to project management and software development that helps teams deliver value to their customers faster and with fewer headaches. Instead of betting everything on a "big bang" launch, an agile team delivers work in small, but consumable, increments. Requirements, plans, and results are evaluated continuously so teams have a natural mechanism for responding to change quickly." <sup>[[1]](#3-Source)</sup>

### 2.1 Agile manifesto
The agile manifesto exist of 12 principles and 4 principles that are listed below:
The 4 agile values are listed below,
1) **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
2) **Working software** over comprehensive documentation
3) **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
4) **Responding to change** over following a plan

<br>

The 12 principles are listed below,
1)	Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
2)	Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.
3)	Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.
4)	Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.
5)	Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.
6)	The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.
7)	Working software is the primary measure of progress.
8)	Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
9)	Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.
10)	Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount of work not done--is essential.
11)	The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.
12)	At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.

## 3. Agile Methodologies


### 3.1 Scrum
Accourding to : "To understand the philosophy behind Scrum, it’s helpful to consider its origin. ‘Scrum’ is a rugby term that refers to a formation in which each player has a particular role. However, every member works together to achieve the same goal." <sup>[[3]](#3-Source)</sup>

**Benefits** 
1. *Adaptability* – the Scrum process is iterative and the goal is to release a potentially shippable product at the end of each cycle (sprint). This opens up a feedback loop in the process where teams gather new requirements from customers or adapt to changes.
2. *Accelerated Delivery* – In Scrum, the time to market is significantly reduced compared to traditional project management. Most cycles (sprints) continue between 2-4 weeks and teams’ goal is to deliver something functional within that period.
3. *Improved ROI* – Scrum combines frequent market delivery with the idea to release the most valuable functions of a product first. Therefore companies can start realizing profits from a given solution before it’s fully developed. This results in a competitive advantage and increased ROI.
4. *Satisfying Customer Expectations* – One of the main traits of Scrum teams is that they work in sprints and look to deliver working products frequently. As a result, customers can inspect them early in the process and return their feedback. This contributes to building higher-quality products that meet expectations.
5. *Lower Costs* – Continuing from the last point, due to the ability to continuously gain feedback, Scrum also allows teams to deal with risks or defects in a timely manner. This reduces the likelihood of reworks which decreases project costs.
